Curriculum vitae de David Quintanilla Jimenez.  
## PROJECT ANALYISIS.    
### **Target user profile.**  
This project is tailored for individuals seeking access to my curriculum vitae. If you are interested in reviewing my project, you can expect to find my CV, comprising my summary, contact information, additional insights about me, academic data, skills and aptitudes, and information on languages I am proficient in.  
### **Information architecture**  
This project is structured into two columns. The left column showcases my personal photograph, along with various contact options and pertinent additional information. The right column contains a succinct summary detailing my motivations, skills, aptitudes, academic background, and language proficiencies. The layout adheres to the standard CV format.  
### **Visual design**  
As I mentioned earlier, I opted for the standard CV format, signifying a single page of 612x818. Taking into account the color of my shirt in the personal photograph, I chose a blue background for the left column. To add a touch of originality, I introduced a box to highlight my abilities, also in blue to harmonize with the column. The font used is Arial, and I adjusted the weight to lend it a lighter appearance. The right column is background-colored in white to establish a visual contrast. The rest of the page is background-colored in light grey to avoid excessive attention. My name is presented as the sole title in uppercase letters to underscore its significance. The remaining titles are underlined and set in 25px font size. The remaining text is set in 12.5px, all in black.  
Additionally, I decided to create a list to enumerate my academic data, abilities and aptitudes, and languages. To refine my CV further, I incorporated logo images to accompany the contact information.
